Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting the risk associated with loans. Specifically, the model is designed to classify loans as either 0 (healthy loan) or 1 (high-risk loan). Accurate prediction of high-risk loans is crucial for the company to minimize financial losses and manage risk effectively. The analysis involves assessing the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to determine its suitability for deployment.

Performance Metrics

    Accuracy: 0.9924
    Precision:
        Healthy Loans (0): 1.00
        High-Risk Loans (1): 0.87
    Recall:
        Healthy Loans (0): 1.00
        High-Risk Loans (1): 0.89

Recommendation

Based on the results of the logistic regression model, I recommend its use by the company for predicting loan risk, with some caveats. The model demonstrates very high accuracy (99.24%) and performs exceptionally well in predicting healthy loans with perfect precision and recall. This indicates a reliable performance for the majority class (healthy loans).

For high-risk loans, the model also performs well but shows a slight reduction in precision (0.87) and recall (0.89). This suggests that while the model is generally effective, it does have some false positives and false negatives. However, these metrics are still quite strong and indicate that the model can effectively identify a substantial portion of high-risk loans.
